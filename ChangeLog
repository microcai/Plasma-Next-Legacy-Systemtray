wmsystemtray (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add debian directory, so I can create local debs. If a Debian developer
    wants to officially package this for Debian, just let me know and I will
    gladly remove it from my upstream sources.
  * Poorly-behaved apps (i.e. pretty much all of them) die if their tray icon
    window gets destroyed. Use XFixesChangeSaveSet to prevent this from
    happening if someone uses Window Maker's "Kill" on us.
  * Handle the case where poorly-behaved apps try to map their own icon
    instead of letting us do it.
  * Generic configure cleanups.
  * Minor fixes to build cleanly with -Wall.
  * Bump copyright date.
